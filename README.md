## Research

**Synthetic Data Generation for Hierarchical Panoptic Segmentation (ISAE‑SUPAERO)** *(Feb 2025 – Present)* [GitHub](https://github.com/TomasCoelho23/hierarchical-segmentation-with-synthetic-data)  |  [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f7X9e0ARktgJsrhsthU3vcoMlZuTKZIG/view?usp=sharing)

* Benchmarked **Mask2Former** on **PhenoBench** for hierarchical panoptic segmentation, exploring multiple hyperparameter regimes.
* Designed a **ControlNet‑based** pipeline to generate image–mask pairs for data augmentation under limited labels.
* Integrated synthetic samples into the training workflow, improving robustness for vegetation monitoring and space‑agri perception.

## Selected Projects

**ATLAS UAV — Air Cargo Challenge 2024**
Led the **Tail & Fuselage Structures** department for a 12‑person team. Balanced weight, efficiency, and compliance with competition rules while coordinating design, simulation, and manufacturing.

**AeroVision — Airbus "Fly Your Ideas" 2025**
*Co‑developed an AI‑assisted maintenance platform with conversational access to logistics databases and a **RAG assistant** over aircraft manuals. Delivered a working prototype that supported part sourcing and reduced turnaround time.[Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BUn6Mw2Rps3KrnPv9s4DA0DeVOIT4r9X/view?usp=sharing)
