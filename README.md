## Research

**Synthetic Data Generation for Hierarchical Panoptic Segmentation (ISAE‑SUPAERO)** *(Feb 2025 – Present)*

* Benchmarked **Mask2Former** on **PhenoBench** for hierarchical panoptic segmentation, exploring multiple hyperparameter regimes.
* Designed a **ControlNet‑based** pipeline to generate image–mask pairs for data augmentation under limited labels.
* Integrated synthetic samples into the training workflow, improving robustness for vegetation monitoring and space‑agri perception.

## Selected Projects

**ATLAS UAV — Air Cargo Challenge 2024**
Led the **Tail & Fuselage Structures** department for a 12‑person team. Balanced weight, efficiency, and compliance with competition rules while coordinating design, simulation, and manufacturing.

**AeroVision — Airbus "Fly Your Ideas" 2025**
Co‑developed an AI‑assisted maintenance platform with conversational access to logistics databases and a **RAG assistant** over aircraft manuals. Delivered a working prototype that supported part sourcing and reduced turnaround time.
